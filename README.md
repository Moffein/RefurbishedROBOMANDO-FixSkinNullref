## REFURBISHED_ROBOMANDO

A personal take on ROBOMANDO's appearance... _Based on ``Risk of Rain Returns``_<br> - Made by ``@noodlegemo``

This skin mod focuses on giving ROBOMANDO an entirely new look from the original mod _(``RobomandoMod``)_.
<br>Feel free to leave feedback by contacting me through the ``Risk of Rain 2 Modding`` Discord server.

This isn't just a simple skin mod, there are some other tweaks to the ``RobomandoMod`` I thought were interesting or would immerse the player further with the addition of these new skin(s) ... more coming in the future.

## Tweaks
#### _The following may be configured and or disabled._
- Replacing ROBOMANDO's Survivor Icon _(Left & Right Versions)_
- Disables other ROBOMANDO Skins
- Rewritten Descriptions / Language
- Modified Skill Stats / Behaviors
<br>- Includes a faster recovery time from using Utility
<br>- Doesn't interrupt sprinting when using Special on nothing
- Modified Stats for Closer Comparability to ``Risk of Rain Returns``
<br>- Allows a percentage of ROBOMANDO's health to be shield instead

## Plans

I'd obviously add even more skins, hopefully with achievements tied to them.
<br>I would prioritize a new mastery skin for ROBOMANDO
