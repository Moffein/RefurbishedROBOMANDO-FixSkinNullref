## REFURBISHED_ROBOMANDO

A personal take on ROBOMANDO's appearance... _Based on ``Risk of Rain Returns``_<br> - Made by ``@noodlegemo``

This skin mod focuses on giving ROBOMANDO an entirely new look from the original mod _(``RobomandoMod``)_.
<br>Feel free to leave feedback by contacting me through the ``Risk of Rain 2 Modding`` Discord server.

This isn't just a simple skin mod, there are some other tweaks to the ``RobomandoMod`` I thought were interesting or would immerse the player further with the addition of these new skin(s) ... more coming in the future.
